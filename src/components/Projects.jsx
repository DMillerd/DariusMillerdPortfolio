        <ul>
            <li>Meal Genie</li>
                <p>Meal Genie is an application/website that users can use to generate random meals using certain preferences they have set. You can view all ingedients and steps for these meals and even save them for later by logging in!</p>
            <li>Bucketlist</li>
                <p>The Bucketlist webpage was something we used throughout most of the duration of the software development bootcamp, we built upon it to include backend functionalities from both mongoDB and SQL, and even practiced deploying through AWS!</p>

        <p>As a recent graduate as an Associate of Science, I am looking for a way for me to be able to follow my passion for engineering and technology.

My recent graduation from ACC's Software Development Bootcamp has given me countless experiences in learning what it takes to be a software developer. I have learned a lot of the ins and outs of Microsoft's Visual Studio Code with it's amazing extensions. I have crafted numerous applications from scratch using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
